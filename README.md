This repository is my Svelte-based solution to [a job candidate challenge from Lyra Solar](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQu8Vf3kWChnXuKylxWAQuFOzlaFr4SFyAkj-X5UvjjkhC_J5p1YOaZH1bisgtSKrFy6MUXNO9mdWh4/pub).

The project uses Svelte as the UI framework/library, and Vite for bundling. For an alternative solution in React, see https://github.com/samclaus/lyra-challenge-react.

## Technical considerations

The following were present in the original README generated by the `pnpm create vite --template svelte-ts` command. I left them here because they are useful but semi-esoteric things to remember.

**Why `global.d.ts` instead of `compilerOptions.types` inside `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json`?**

Setting `compilerOptions.types` shuts out all other types not explicitly listed in the configuration. Using triple-slash references keeps the default TypeScript setting of accepting type information from the entire workspace, while also adding `svelte` and `vite/client` type information.

**Why enable `allowJs` in the TS template?**

While `allowJs: false` would indeed prevent the use of `.js` files in the project, it does not prevent the use of JavaScript syntax in `.svelte` files. In addition, it would force `checkJs: false`, bringing the worst of both worlds: not being able to guarantee the entire codebase is TypeScript, and also having worse typechecking for the existing JavaScript. In addition, there are valid use cases in which a mixed codebase may be relevant.
